Was bored over summer holidays and decided to finally buid the build system I had in my head. Think `make` but with bit more spice.
Is language agnostic since my main use for `make` was compiling random scripts and tex files together for assignments. Because of this you
shouldn't expect it to be very performant (But it isn't going to be a snails pace so do please report if its too slow)
